We're looking for interested post-docs or research scientists to come join us at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. We accept grad student rotations from the <a href="https://graduate.dartmouth.edu/mcb/">Molecular and Cellular Biology Program</a> and the <a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/qbs/">Graduate Program in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences</a>. Students from other programs are welcome to rotate according to the rules of their program.
